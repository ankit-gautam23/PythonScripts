**Here I am gonna create a script which can extract error from postman response and can try to find the solution over stack overflow and github**


Certainly! Here are the steps to run the Python script:

Install Python: If you haven't already, download and install Python from the official website for your operating system: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install requests module: Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux) and run the following command to install the requests module: pip install requests

Copy the script: Copy the script I provided earlier and paste it into a new file using a text editor like Notepad, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code.

Save the script: Save the script with a filename and a ".py" extension, such as "api_error_solutions.py".

Add your GitHub token: Replace "YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" with your personal access token for GitHub in the search_github function. If you don't have a token, you can create one by following the instructions here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

Run the script: Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux), navigate to the directory where the script is saved, and run the command python api_error_solutions.py.

Test the script: Test the script by entering a sample response body that contains an error message, such as {"error": "Unauthorized"}. The script should output a message suggesting a solution and links to relevant resources on Stack Overflow and GitHub.

**In the next script I will try to do something where I can apply these solutions from github and check if something workss or not**
