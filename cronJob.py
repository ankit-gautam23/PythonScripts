# To write a cron job in Python to fetch files at a specific time, you can use the built-in cron module in Python. 
#Here's an example script that fetches files every day at 3:00 am:

import os
import datetime
import requests

def fetch_files():
    # Replace this URL with the URL of the files you want to fetch
    url = "https://example.com/files"
    response = requests.get(url)
    # Replace the path with the directory where you want to save the files
    save_path = "/home/user/files/"
    # Create the directory if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(save_path):
        os.makedirs(save_path)
    # Save the files with the current date and time as the filename
    filename = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S") + ".txt"
    with open(save_path + filename, "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)

if _name_ == '_main_':
    fetch_files()

    
# To schedule this script to run every day at 3:00 am using cron, follow these steps:

# Open your crontab file by running crontab -e in your terminal.
# Add the following line to the end of the file: 0 3 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
# Save the file and exit.
# This will run your script every day at 3:00 am. Make sure to replace /path/to/your/script.py with the actual path to your script.
